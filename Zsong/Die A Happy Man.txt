Die a Happy Man

Baby last night was hands down . 
One of the best night that i've had no doubt.
between the bottle of wine and
the look in your eyes and the Marvin gaye.
then we danced in the dark under september stars
in the pourin' rain .
*
and i know that i can't ever tell u enough
that all i need in this life is your crazy love 
if i never get to see the northern lights 
if i never see the eiffel tower at night 
Oh if all i got is your hand in my hand 
baby i could die a happy man , happy man baby

baby that red dress brings me to my knees
oh , but that black dress huh makesit hard 
to breathe 

u r a saint, you're godddes and the cutest ,hottest
a masterpiece
it s to good to be true Nothing better than u 
in my wildrest dreams

*

i dont need no vacation , no fancy destination
baby u are my great escape
we could stay at home listen to the radio
dance around the fireplace 

if i never get to build my mansion in georgia
or drive a sport car up the coast of the california
